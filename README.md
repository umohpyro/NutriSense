Nutrisense - Your friendly intelligent pidgin diet assistant

<img src="nutrisense-landing.PNG" width="100%"/>

## Introduction

An AI project that utilizes the ChatGPT API but fully customized to only respond to health and diet related prompts. nutrisense is a web application that generates personalized diet plans based on user preferences and dietary restrictions. It uses the GPT-3 language model to generate meal plans and recipes that meet the user's needs. The application is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, OpenAI, NextAuth and Prisma ORM.

nutrisense was inspired by a personal need for quick and healthy meal ideas. As busy professionals with busy schedules, we found it difficult to consistently make nutritious meals for ourselves and our families. We wanted a solution that was convenient, accessible, and tailored to our specific dietary needs and preferences. This project was developed as a Portfolio Project for ALX SE Program, as part of our training to become full-stack software engineers. I am proud to have developed a solution that addresses a common problem for many people, and I hope that this chatbot will help others eat healthier and save time in the kitchen.
